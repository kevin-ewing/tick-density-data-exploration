# tick-density-data-exploration

To run the shiny from this repository, paste and run the following in the R console: `runGitHub("tick-pathogen-data-exploration", "kevin-ewing")`

The app is also hosted on `shinyapps.io`, availible here: [Tick Density](https://kevin-ewing.shinyapps.io/FinalTickDensity/).

Please be patient as the apps load when run locally and on `shinyapps.io`. The `.geojson` files and data may take time to populate the maps.
